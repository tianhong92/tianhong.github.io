I have been thinking for a while to create my own personal tech blog to record my tech studies. And I came accross Hexo, a simple blog framework for us to create our own blogs. It's super helpful for non front-end developers. Here are the steps you can follow.

# Steps 

## Download node.js
Here I use node-v5.6.0

## Install Hexo and packages

	$ npm install -g hexo
	$ hexo init
	$ npm install

You will be able to view the default blog page (localhost:4000) generated by hexo locally after type in,
    
    $ hexo g 
    $ hexo s

## Deploy code to github

You need to create a github repository following the naming pattern: "yourname.github.io", then edit the _config.yml file in the root path.

Download the hexo-deployer-git plugin.

	$ npm install hexo-deployer-git --save

After set up the ssh keys, you should be able to deploy code to github. 

	$ hexo g
	$ hexo d

Then, you can view the blog page from github using the url: yourname.github.io


## Add themes to your blog

Download a theme for your blog is easy, you can do it like this:

	$ git clone https://github.com/wuchong/jacman.git themes/jacman

After you execute this command, a theme "jacman" will be intalled to the "themes" folder, and what you need to do is adding to _config_yml file, replace the default theme "landscape".

More themes would be available in [Hexo](https://hexo.io/themes/).

## Add new blog

At this point, creat a new blog is simply by typing the command

	$ hexo new
